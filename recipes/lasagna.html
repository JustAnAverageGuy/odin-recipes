        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion (finely diced)</li>
        <li>3/4 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>3/4 lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients and set aside</li>
        <li>heat olive oil and add diced onions. Let them soften for ten minutes</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and sausage, cook for 8-10 minutes and add garlic for the last minute</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth, marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, Worcesteshire sauce.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°</li>
        <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.        </li>
        <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.        </li>
        <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. If desired, broil at 450° to brown the top more, watch it carefully during this time.</li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
